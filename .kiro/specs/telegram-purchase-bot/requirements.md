# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a Telegram bot that handles user authentication and subscription purchases for group access. The bot will manage daily, weekly, and monthly subscription packages, process payments through Mpesa, and automatically manage group membership based on subscription status. Users will need to manually renew their subscriptions upon expiration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to purchase subscription packages through the Telegram bot, so that I can gain access to a private Telegram group.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts the bot THEN the system SHALL present subscription package options (daily, weekly, monthly)
2. WHEN a user selects a package THEN the system SHALL display the price and initiate Mpesa payment process
3. WHEN a user completes payment THEN the system SHALL verify the transaction and grant group access
4. IF payment verification fails THEN the system SHALL notify the user and provide retry options

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be automatically added to the private group after successful payment, so that I can access the content immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN payment is verified THEN the system SHALL automatically add the user to the configured Telegram group
2. WHEN user is added to group THEN the system SHALL record the subscription start date and expiration date
3. IF group addition fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and notify administrators
4. WHEN subscription is active THEN the system SHALL maintain user's group membership

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive notifications about my subscription status, so that I know when renewal is needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN subscription is about to expire (24 hours before) THEN the system SHALL send expiration warning to user
2. WHEN subscription expires THEN the system SHALL remove user from group and send expiration notification
3. WHEN user is removed due to expiration THEN the system SHALL provide renewal instructions
4. IF user attempts to use bot with expired subscription THEN the system SHALL prompt for renewal

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to renew my subscription manually, so that I can continue accessing the group after expiration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user requests renewal THEN the system SHALL present available subscription packages
2. WHEN user completes renewal payment THEN the system SHALL extend subscription period from current date
3. WHEN renewal is successful THEN the system SHALL re-add user to group if previously removed
4. IF user has active subscription and attempts renewal THEN the system SHALL extend the existing subscription

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want the bot to use environment configuration for Mpesa and Telegram settings, so that I can easily deploy and manage the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN bot starts THEN the system SHALL load all Mpesa API credentials from environment variables
2. WHEN bot starts THEN the system SHALL load Telegram bot token and group ID from environment variables
3. WHEN bot starts THEN the system SHALL load subscription pricing from environment variables
4. IF required environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL fail to start with clear error messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to track all transactions and user subscriptions, so that I can monitor system usage and revenue.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN payment is processed THEN the system SHALL log transaction details including amount, user, and timestamp
2. WHEN user subscription changes THEN the system SHALL log subscription status changes
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
4. WHEN administrator requests THEN the system SHALL provide subscription and transaction reports

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want secure payment processing through Mpesa, so that my financial information is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN payment is initiated THEN the system SHALL use official Mpesa API endpoints
2. WHEN processing payments THEN the system SHALL validate all transaction data
3. WHEN storing transaction data THEN the system SHALL not store sensitive payment information
4. IF Mpesa API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error messages to users
